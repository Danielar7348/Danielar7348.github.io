This week I have overall learned how to collaborate with my teammates and how to get work done on my own, and how to help out my teammates when they are coding to make sure there isn't a mistake being made. Overall, I feel like I still need to review or pratice a bit with what I've learned overall, because I feel like I have been growing as a scholar, but I still have a bit of difficulties in a few things that I still need to properly undertand.
