This week I learned how to pair program and how to watch over my partner's work and make sure to catch the smallest little error or something that might be missing in our work. I feel like my work has definitely improved and I'm starting to understand more how to pair program and code. And, I feel like I'm still growing little by little as I work harder and review over more.

On the other hand, my stuggles that I'm still facing is, remembering the formulas. One question I have is, does the computer always understand a certain command? I feel like more support that my class should give them selves is giving their classmates more feedback in how they could improve their work.
