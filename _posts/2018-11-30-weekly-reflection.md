This week we reviewed what we over all know and have learned and we also took an assesment this week. One of the questions that I liked was question #2 because it explains what it is asking you to require and it isn't so difficult as the rest of the questions.
The assesment was a little challenging especially because I still need to get use to the basics and all the formulas.
