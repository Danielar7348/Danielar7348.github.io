Your first impressions of the class: 
My first impression of the class was how intresting computer science is and how tricky and hard it could be, when learning computer science it is important to pay attention because it could be really more difficult if you don't pay attention to the instructions or the information that is necessary to know in order to understand.

Anything you learned?:
Yes, I learned so far to create my own blog and website and all the basics of computer science.
Your biggest challenge:
My biggest challenge was understanding the steps that were given to us to create a blog, because I feel like the instructions were not specific enough.
